# What is Bootstrap?

To break it down in simple and easy to understand language, Twitter bootstrap is a free, open-source collection of tools that aids in creating websites or web applications. This toolset includes pre-developed HTML and CSS templates for typography, forms, buttons, charts, navigation and other components.

Originally the project was developed and funded by Twitter as an internal resource for helping develop consistent design patterns. After its initial use, Twitter knew the project could develop into something much more and decided in August 2011 to release it as an open-source project. Now, almost a year later from bootstrap's public release, it's one of the most popular coding projects in the developer community and is now used by many of the top websites and applications in the world.

# Why is Bootstrap so cool?

Ok, so we now know that bootstrap is this toolkit for web developers, but why is this toolset so cool and what are the benefits of using bootstrap? Well above the awesome name, boostrap has a laundry list of reasons that it's such a great toolset.

**Responsive:** bootstrap has been coded with responsive design in order to cater to users with all different screen sizes. Being responsive, bootstrap is set up for the future of internet use including phones, tablets, desktops and whatever else technology throws at us.

**Consistency:** One of the main reasons this toolset was developed was because Twitter was seeing big inconsistencies between developers working on their projects. This caused some issues both on a developer level and user level. So in an effort to save time, energy and headache one central set of development code was created.

**Build on and With the Latest and Greatest:** Built by some of the development word's "geekiest" developers, boostrap was built with and developed with the latest CSS3, HTML5 and jQuery libraries. Additionally, the CSS was developed on the LESS platform which saves time in both development and design.

**Saves Time:** Twitter bootstrap saves time for two reasons. One, developers can pull from the bootstrap libraries extremely fast to create many of the items on a website. The fact the code is already created and ready to go speeds up development time.
